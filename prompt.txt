**TASK:** Act as an expert food data parser. Extract nutritional information, ingredients, allergens, and warnings from the provided "Text to Analyze."
For any data point not found, use `null`.

**OUTPUT:** Your response MUST be a single JSON object. Do not include any conversational filler or explanations.

**TEXT TO ANALYZE:**
{user_text}


**Task:**
Using the extracted `ingredients`, `nutrition_facts`, `allergens`, and `warnings` from TEXT TO ANALYZE, analyze the product against the following dietary filters and your provided knowledge base. 
Each filter name should perfectly match those listed in "Dietary Filters and Rules".
For each filter, provide a `result`, a precise `reason` and a list of `cautious-ingredients`. 


* **Result Logic:**
    * **Fail:** The product contains one or more ingredients listed under the filter's **AVOID** rules.
    * **Caution:** The product contains an ingredient or meets a condition listed under the filter's **WARNING** rules OR a **MONITOR** value has been exceeded based on the `value_per_serving` from `nutrition_facts`.
    * **Pass:** The product does not contain any ingredients or conditions that trigger a "Fail" or "Caution" result.
* **Reasoning Details:**
    * The `reason` string **MUST** be specific. It should directly quote or reference the exact ingredient(s) from the `ingredients` list, allergen from `allergens`, warning from `warnings`, or the specific `nutrient_name` and `value_per_serving` from `nutrition_facts` that triggered the "Fail" or "Caution" result. If passing, state "No conflicting ingredients or nutritional values found."
* **Dangerous Ingredients:**
    * The `cautious-ingredients` string should list the ingredients (seperated by commas) that cause th filter to fail. If there are none, it should be set equal to null.
